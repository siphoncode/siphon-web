    <div class="docs__headline">How to run a React Native app on your device</div>
    <p>We're going to show you how to quickly create a React Native app and run it on
    your iPhone with <a href="https://getsiphon.com">Siphon</a>. You will need a Mac to follow this tutorial.</p>
    <p>Our command-line tool walks you through all the steps required to provision
    your device and download any missing dependencies. You don't need to open
    Xcode or even run the React Native packager.</p>
    <p style="color: #aaaaaa">For now we only support iOS for running an app on your device. Android support is coming soon.</p>

    <a name="install-cli"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Install the command-line client</div>
    <p>To get started with Siphon you will need to download our lightweight command-line tool. Paste the following command into a terminal window:</p>
    <div class="docs__code"><span>$ </span>curl https://getsiphon.com/install.sh | sh</div>
    <p>The installer script will take a few seconds to complete. Once that's done, check that the tool is working:</p>
    <div class="docs__code"><span>$ </span>siphon --help</div>

    <div class="docs__subheading">Create a Siphon account</div>
    <p>If you don't have one yet, you will need to quickly create a Siphon account. This is where your apps will be stored.</p>
    <p><a class="docs__content__button" href="{% url 'accounts:register' %}" target="_blank">Create a free account</a></p>
    <p>It only takes a few moments. Come back to this page when you're finished.</p>

    <a name="create-app"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Create an app</div>
    <p>We're going to need an app to run on the device. The command-line tool can
    make us a simple template app in one step.</p>
    <p>Navigate to a suitable directory (anywhere is fine) and type the following
    command to create a new app:</p>
    <div class="docs__code"><span>$ </span>siphon create my-app</div>
    <p>You can name the app anything you like. The tool creates a new directory with same name.</p>

    <a name="run-on-device"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Run the app on your device</div>
    <p>First, make sure your iPhone is plugged in to your machine with a USB cable. You're going
    to need an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/">Apple Developer</a>
    account to run a development app on your device.</p>
    <p>Type the following into your terminal:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>cd my-app<br />
        <span>$ </span>siphon play
    </div>
    <p><strong>That's it!</strong> The tool is going to walk you through all of the required steps needed to
    prepare your machine and provision your device.</p>
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>
            You can also run the app on your local machine using the iOS simulator by typing
            in <span class="docs__technical">siphon develop</span>. <a href="{% url 'docs:quickstart' %}">Learn more</a> about
