    <div class="docs__headline">Frequently Asked Questions</div>

    <a name="what-is-this"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">What is this?</div>
    <p>Siphon is a new workflow for mobile app development. We believe that
    despite the many recent advances in IDEs, languages and tooling, the
    process of building native mobile apps is still far too clunky.</p>
    <p>Siphon apps are written in JavaScript with the
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> framework. Follow our
    <a href="{% url 'docs:quickstart' %}">quickstart tutorial</a> to get started.</p>

    <a name="what-can-i-do"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">What can I do?</div>
    <p>Please refer to our <a href="{% url 'docs:quickstart' %}">quickstart</a> page to learn about Siphon's features.</p>

    <a name="publishing"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">How do I publish my app to the App Store and GoogleÂ Play?</div>
    <p>When you type in the <span class="docs__technical">siphon publish</span>
    command we will ask you to enter your iOS developer account or Google Play publisher
    account details. We then build, sign and package an app binary for you behind-the-scenes.</p>
    <p>The app binary is submitted to the App Store or Google Play on your behalf. It will be listed under your own account name.</p>
    <p>To make changes to an app that is already listed, you can
    run <span class="docs__technical">siphon publish</span> again and we will
    automatically detect whether the update can be issued over-the-air (usually) or if it requires
    a new binary to be submitted.</p>
    <p>Publishing requires a paid plan for commercial apps. Please refer to the <a href="{% url 'static:pricing' %}">pricing page</a> for more information.</p>

    <a name="assets"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">How do I use assets in my app?</div>
    <p>Siphon supports the asset format recommended by React Native:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/image-asset.html" %}
    <p>You should place your assets in the app directory alongside your
    JavaScript source files. Placing them in subdirectories is fine too.</p>
    <p>When you run <span class="docs__technical">siphon push</span> we will process these assets and host them for you.
    An end-user device will only download new or changed assets when it synchronises,
    saving time and bandwidth.</p>
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>
            We recommend reading the
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/images.html">
                official React Native guide on images and assets
            </a> for more information.
        </span>
    </div>

    <a name="logs-and-errors"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">How do I view console logs and errors?</div>
    <p>Navigate to your app directory and type in <span class="docs__technical">siphon logs</span>. Logs and
    error messages will be streamed from your device whenever this command is running.</p>

    <a name="native-modules"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Native modules</div>
    <p>In order for us to ensure that your app behaves the same across the sandbox, simulator and
    developer devices we introduced a constraint: you can not link your own
    custom <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html">native modules</a> to a Siphon app.</p>
    <p>This makes it possible for us to say that you never need to open Xcode or Android Studio to use Siphon. But you may be left wondering
    how to use native functionality not provided by the React Native core library.</p>
    <p>The good news is, we bundle lots of the <a href="{% url 'docs:base-version' %}">most popular native modules</a> for you behind-the-scenes.
    You can use them in your apps straight away; simply reference them in your JavaScript code.</p>
    <p><strong><a href="{% url 'docs:base-version' %}">See the list of available native modules</a></strong></p>
    <p>Please <a href="mailto:hello@getsiphon.com">let us know</a> if there are any native modules that you need for your app, and
    we will try to integrate them for everyone to use.</p>

    <a name="third-party"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Third-party libraries</div>
    <p>The app directory created by Siphon works like a typical Node.js project directory.
    You can install suitable third-party modules using <span class="docs__technical">npm install</span>
    and the command-line tool will push the <span class="docs__technical">node_modules</span> directory and bundle it with your app.</p>
    <p>Please note that this only works for <strong>pure JavaScript</strong> libraries.
    We do not (and will not for the foreseeable future) support custom native modules. However we do include
    some <a href="{% url 'docs:base-version' %}">popular native modules</a> for you to use in your app.</p>
    <p>Please <a href="mailto:hello@getsiphon.com">let us know</a> if there are any native modules that you need for your app, and
    we will try to integrate them for everyone to use.</p>

    <a name="is-this-allowed"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Are over-the-air updates allowed by Apple?</div>
    <p>Yes. Because React Native apps are written in JavaScript we fall nicely under
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/information/iOS_Program_Information_4_3_15.pdf">Section 3.3.2</a>
    of the iOS Developer Program agreement. Hot pushes are explicitly allowed in this case.</p>

    <a name="android"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Can I build Android apps with Siphon?</div>
    <p>Yes! You can run them in the Siphon Sandbox app, which
    is available on both Apple's <a href="https://getsiphon.com/i">App Store</a> and
    Google's <a href="https://getsiphon.com/a">Play Store</a>.</ins></p>
    <p>Emulator and device support for Android is coming soon.</p>

    <a name="change-base-version"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Change your app's base version</div>
    <p>When you first run the <span class="docs__technical">siphon create</span> command, we
    automatically assign your app a special value called a <a href="{% url 'docs:base-version' %}">base version</a> behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>It ties your app to a particular version of React Native and also guarantees that a certain set
    of native modules are available to be referenced within your app's JavaScript code.</p>
    <p><a href="{% url 'docs:base-version' %}#changing-base-version">How to change your app's base version</a></p>

    <a name="display-name"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Change your app's display name</div>
    <p>By default, when you run or publish your app standalone (i.e. outside of the sandbox) it will appear
    with the app's internal name on the home screen.
    <p>For example, if you typed <span class="docs__technical">siphon create my-app</span> when you first
    initialised the app, the text that appears under the app icon will say <strong>my-app</strong>.</p>
    <p>To change this behaviour, edit the file named <span class="docs__technical">Siphonfile</span> in the
    app directory and add a <span class="docs__technical">display_name</span> key, so that it looks
    like something like this:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/display-name.html" %}
    <p>Finally, run a <span class="docs__technical">siphon push</span> to reflect the change. If your app is already listed on the App Store or Play Store, you will need to run <span class="docs__technical">siphon publish</span> again to change its display name.</p>
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>
            The <span class="docs__technical">display_name</span> key has a maximum length of 32 characters and can
            contain any valid unicode characters. Please check the
            App Store and Play Store rules before you publish to make sure that the chosen display name is acceptable.
        </span>
    </div>

    <a name="dot-siphonignore"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Ignoring files</div>
    <p>
      By default, your app directory will include a <span class="docs__technical">.siphonignore</span> file.
      This file is used by the Siphon client to decide which files in your app directory it
      should ignore when pushing your app or running it on the simulator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <span class="docs__technical">.siphonignore</span> file uses the following rules:
    </p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/dot-siphonignore.html" %}
    <p>
      Many Node.js modules are ignored by default to improve compatibility with existing React Native apps.
      If you wish to use one in your app that is being ignored, you can
      delete the corresponding entry in the <span class="docs__technical">.siphonignore</span> file.
    </p>

    <a name="permissions"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Permissions</div>
    <p>Due to the nature of iOS and the way in which we allow you to run
    multiple apps in the sandbox, we have to be careful about apps
    requesting permissions (e.g. camera access, geolocation).</p>
    <p>For example, the <span class="docs__technical">Geolocation</span> API currently returns dummy GPS
    coordinates when your app runs in the sandbox.</p>

    <a name="over-the-air-updates"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">How do over-the-air updates work?</div>
    <p>For the vast majority updates (i.e. those that do not require a new version of React Native) we let
    you push changes to your users without going through the App Store approval process each time.</p>
    <p>A user's device checks for updates when the app first loads, or when it enters the foreground
    after a set period of inactivity. Any problems communicating over the network are hidden from the user;
    the app will simply try to update itself again next time it enters the foreground.</p>
    <p>To make this process fast and efficient, we generate diffs when your app bundle changes
    (i.e. when the app's JavaScript source code is modified) so that only the minimum needs to be sent over the network.
    It should typically take less than 5 seconds for most network connections.</p>
    <p>In the case of images and other assets, we cache these on the user's device so that
    only new or changed assets need to be fetched over the network.</p>
