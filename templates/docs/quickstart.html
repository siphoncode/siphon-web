    <div class="docs__headline">Quickstart</div>
    <p>Siphon is primarily a command-line tool. This quickstart tutorial will
    walk you through the installation process and then describe all
    of the ways that you can interact with the service.</p>

    <a name="install-cli"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Install the command-line client</div>
    <p>To get started with Siphon you will need to download our lightweight command-line tool. Paste the following command into a terminal window:</p>
    <div class="docs__code"><span>$ </span>curl https://getsiphon.com/install.sh | sh</div>
    <p>The installer script will take a few seconds to complete. Once that's done, check that the tool is working:</p>
    <div class="docs__code"><span>$ </span>siphon --help</div>
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line" target="_blank">Read a beginners guide to using the terminal</a>
    </div>

    <a name="download-sandbox"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Download and run the Siphon Sandbox app</div>
    <p>One way to run apps is by installing the Siphon Sandbox app onto your device. Open up your phone's browser and type in <thead>
      the following address if it's an <strong>iPhone</strong>:</thead></p>
    <div>
      <a class="docs__content__big-link" href="https://getsiphon.com/i">getsiphon.com/i</a>
    </div>
    <p>Or, if it's an <strong>Android</strong> device:</p>
    <div>
      <a class="docs__content__big-link" href="https://getsiphon.com/a">getsiphon.com/a</a>
    </div>
    <p>Once that's done, login with your Siphon account. No account yet?</p>
    <p><a class="docs__content__button" href="{% url 'accounts:register' %}?from_tutorial=1">Create a free account</a></p>
    <p>You can also use the <span class="docs__technical">siphon play</span> command to run your apps in the simulator. More on that below.</p>
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>You can run both iOS and Android apps through our sandbox app. Android simulator support
        is coming soon.</span>
    </div>

    <a name="create-app"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Create your first app</div>
    <img class="docs__content__create-app-image" src="{% static "img/docs/quickstart/create-app.png" %}" width="251" height="213" />
    <p>Navigate to a suitable directory (anywhere is fine) and type the following
    command to create a new app:</p>
    <div class="docs__code" style="display: inline-block;"><span>$ </span>siphon create my-app</div>
    <div class="docs__code-sublink">
        <a href="{% url 'docs:existing-react-native-app' %}">How do I convert an existing React Native app?</a>
    </div>
    <p>You can name the app anything you like. The tool creates a new directory with same name.</p>
    <div>
        <p>The new directory contains a simple React Native template app. Once the command finishes
        running, the new app is going to appear in the Siphon Sandbox.</p>
        <p>Next, <strong>tap on the icon</strong> to start the app; it's going to load over-the-air.</p>
    </div>

    <a name="push-changes"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Push some changes to your app</div>
    <p>Now let's try making some changes. Navigate into the newly created
    directory and open up <span class="docs__technical">index.js</span> in
    your favourite editor.</p>
    <p>Change some of the template text within the <span class="docs__technical">&#x3C;Text&#x3E;</span> tag and save the file.</p>
    <div class="docs__content__push-changes-image">
        <img src="{% static "img/docs/quickstart/push-changes.gif" %}" width="753" height="289" />
    </div>
    <div class="docs__content__react-native-blurb">
        <span>Siphon apps are powered by React Native under the hood. Learn more <br />about it here:
        <a href="http://www.toptal.com/ios/cold-dive-into-react-native-a-beginners-tutorial" target="_blank">React Native: A Beginner's Tutorial</a></span>
    </div>
    <p>Next, push your changes with the command-line tool:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>siphon push
    </div>
    <p>The app should now automatically reload on the phone and display your changes. Instead of typing in this
    command for every change, you can also use the tool to <strong>watch</strong> your app for changes:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>siphon push --watch
    </div>
    <p>Every time you save a change to one of your app's files, the tool will push those changes automatically. This
    makes the process of developing your app much more pleasant.</p>
    <p>To stream logs and errors from your app as it runs in the sandbox, you can use the
    <span class="docs__technical">siphon logs</span> command.
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>
            The app directory works like a typical Node.js project directory; you can install <br />
            suitable third-party modules using <span class="docs__technical">npm install</span>
            and the command-line tool will push the <span class="docs__technical">node_modules</span> directory and bundle it with your app.
        </span>
    </div>

    <a name="running-in-the-simulator"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Running your app in the simulator</div>
    <p>If you're using a Mac, there's a way to run your app in the iOS simulator. Navigate to your app directory
    and type in:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>siphon develop
    </div>
    <p>The tool will prompt you to install Xcode and any other necessary components that you haven't already
    installed on your local machine.</p>
    <p>It will then build and run your project as a standalone app in the simulator
    while running the React Native packager in the background (so you get the benefits of
    <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2016/03/24/introducing-hot-reloading.html">Hot Reloading</a>).</p>
    <p>You can specify other simulator types like this:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>siphon develop --simulator ipad2
    </div>
    <p style="color:#aaaaaa">Soon you will also be able to run your app in the Android emulator, but for
    now you should use the <a href="/a">sandbox</a>.</p>
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>To run an app on your developer device you should use
        <a href="{% url 'docs:run-on-device' %}">siphon play</a>.</span>
    </div>

    <a name="beta-testing"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Sharing your app with beta testers</div>
    <p>Before publishing an app it can be useful to send it to beta testers so that they can give you feedback.
    Simply specify an email address and we will send them an invitation
    to beta test your app:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>siphon share someone@domain.com
    </div>
    <p>No approval is required and the recipient will be prompted to create a
    Siphon account if they do not already have one. The user will see a special read-only copy of your app and
    you can instantly send them <a href="{% url 'docs:beta-testing' %}#sharing-changes">changes</a> as often
    as you like.</p>
    <p><a href="{% url 'docs:beta-testing' %}">Learn more about beta testing</a></p>

    <a name="publishing"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Publishing your app</div>
    <p>When you're finished working on an app, you can publish it by typing in one command:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>siphon publish --platform ios
    </div>
    <p>You will be prompted to enter some basic information about your app, like a description and some keywords.</p>
    <p>Behind-the-scenes we will build, sign, package and submit an app binary on your behalf.</p>
    <p><a href="{% url 'docs:faq' %}#publishing">Read more about how publishing works</a></p>
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>
            Publishing to the App Store and Google Play requires a
            <a href="{% url 'static:pricing' %}">paid subscription</a>.
        </span>
    </div>

    <a name="next-up"></a>
