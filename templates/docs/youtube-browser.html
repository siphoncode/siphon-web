    <div class="docs__headline">Build a YouTube playlist browser with React Native and Siphon</div>
    <p>We're going to use <a href="https://getsiphon.com">Siphon</a> to quickly build a
    React Native app from scratch. The finished app will display a live YouTube playlist
    and let you play a video by tapping it.</p>
    <p>You will learn all about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fetching a remote data source</li>
        <li>Parsing XML using the <span class="docs__technical">xmldom</span> library</li>
        <li>How to use React Native's <span class="docs__technical">Navigator</span> component</li>
        <li>Integrating the <span class="docs__technical">react-native-youtube</span> library (<strong>note:</strong> that it's only currently available for <strong>iOS</strong>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please follow the <a href="{% url 'docs:quickstart' %}">quickstart tutorial</a> first if
    you haven't already set up your machine to use Siphon.</p>
    <p><a class="docs__content__button" href="{% url 'docs:quickstart' %}">Install the command-line tool</a></p>
    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/getsiphon/siphon-youtube-video-browser">finished app</a> will look
    something like this:</p>
    <p><img src="{% static "img/docs/youtube-browser/playlist.jpg" %}" width="200" height="398" /></p>

    <a name="create-app"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Create a new Siphon app</div>
    <p>First, navigate to a suitable directory (anywhere is fine) and type the following
    command to create a new app:</p>
    <div class="docs__code"><span>$ </span>siphon create youtube-browser</div>
    <p>You can call it anything you like, but for the rest of this tutorial we will refer to the app as <strong>youtube-browser</strong>.</p>
    <p>A new directory containing the basic app template will be created on your local machine and the files will be pushed to our servers.</p>
    <p>Open up the <a href="/a" target="_blank">Siphon Sandbox</a> app on your iOS device
    and <strong>tap the new app icon</strong> to run it. Alternatively, if you have a Mac, you
    can also run it standalone on your iOS device like this:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>cd youtube-browser<br />
        <span>$ </span>siphon play
    </div>
    <p>Or to run it on an iOS simulator with access to the full React Native
      debugging environment you can use the develop command:</p>
     <div class="docs__code">
         <span>$ </span>cd youtube-browser<br />
         <span>$ </span>siphon develop
     </div>

    <a name="remove-template-content"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Remove the template app content</div>
    <p>We want to start with a blank slate, so let's remove all of the views that come with the
    template app.
    <p>Open up the <span class="docs__technical">youtube-browser/index.js</span> file in
    your favourite editor and edit it so that it looks like this:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-blank-app.html" %}
    <p>When you hit save, run <span class="docs__technical">siphon push</span> and the app will reload itself.
    You should see some basic text.</p>

    <a name="video-list-placeholder"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Add a placeholder for the video list screen</div>
    <p>Later we're going to need a view to display a list of video thumbnails, so lets add a placeholder for that
    now. Make a new subdirectory within your app's directory:</p>
    <div class="docs__code"><span>$ </span>mkdir components<br /></div>
    <p>Then, using your chosen text editor, make a new file in the <strong>components</strong> subdirectory,
    call it <span class="docs__technical">VideoListView.js</span>, and paste in the following code:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-video-list.html" %}
    <p>Notice that it's ready to render an <span class="docs__technical">&#x3C;Image&#x3E;</span> component for each video
    in the playlist, but for now it will be empty because we have no data.</p>
    <p>Next, edit your <span class="docs__technical">index.js</span> file to import and display our new list view:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-video-list-app.html" %}
    <p>The purpose of the <span class="docs__technical">playlistID</span> property that we passed into
    <span class="docs__technical">&#x3C;VideoListView&#x3E;</span> will become clear later.
    Note that if you push your changes now, the app will render as an empty white screen.</p>

    <a name="install-xml-parser"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Install an XML parser</div>
    <p>In the next section, we're going to parse a YouTube playlist that comes in an XML format.</p>
    <p>For that we're going to use the <span class="docs__technical">xmldom</span> library. If you don't
    already have <span class="docs__technical">npm</span> installed on your machine,
    <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm">click here</a> to learn how to install it.</p>
    <p>To install the library, navigate to your app directory and type in:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>npm install xmldom
    </div>
    <p>If successful, you should see a newly created <span class="docs__technical">node_modules</span> directory.
    <div class="docs__content__help-section">
        <span>
            Your app directory works like a typical Node.js project directory; you can install <br />
            suitable third-party modules using <span class="docs__technical">npm install</span>
            and the command-line tool will push the <span class="docs__technical">node_modules</span> directory and bundle it with your app.
        </span>
    </div>

    <a name="fetch-parse-display-playlist"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Fetch, parse and display a YouTube playlist</div>
    <p>Our app is going to display a particular YouTube playlist and let you tap a thumbnail to play a
    video. First we're going to need to fetch the playlist and parse it into a more convenient format.</p>

    <p>YouTube kindly provides an API endpoint that requires no authentication and returns a playlist feed as XML:</p>
    <p><span class="docs__technical">https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLAYLIST-ID-HERE</span></p>
    <p>For example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?playlist_id=PLF76F25F55798FDBC">here's a playlist feed</a>
    containing some funny cat videos. Let's add some code that fetches the feed and outputs the result to the console.</p>

    <p><strong>Stream the logs</strong></p>
    <p>First, make sure that you're streaming the logs for your app, because we're going to
    output to the console for now. Open up another terminal window, navigate to the
    app directory and type in:</p>
    <div class="docs__code">
        <span>$ </span>siphon logs
    </div>
    <p>Be sure to leave this terminal window open for the rest of the tutorial.</p>

    <p><strong>Fetch the feed</strong></p>
    <p>Let's add some code that uses the built-in React Native <span class="docs__technical">fetch()</span> function to retrieve the
    playlist we want to parse. For now we'll just use the cat video playlist.</p>
    <p>Modify your <span class="docs__technical">components/VideoListView.js</span>
    file by adding these three methods to the <span class="docs__technical">VideoListView</span> class:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-fetch.html" %}
    <p>When the app loads, it's going to grab the remote feed and then log the length of the returned text to the
    console. Run <span class="docs__technical">siphon push</span> and try it.<p>

    <p><strong>Parse the feed</strong></p>
    <p>Now we're going to use the <span class="docs__technical">xmldom</span> library to parse the result.
    First put the following line at the top of your <span class="docs__technical">components/VideoListView.js</span> file,
    above the class definition:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-require-xmldom.html" %}
    <p>Then modify the <span class="docs__technical">parseVideos()</span> method in your
    <span class="docs__technical">VideoListView</span> class to extract a thumbnail URL and video ID for each feed item:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-parse-xml.html" %}
    <p>Now run <span class="docs__technical">siphon push</span> and you should see a list of thumbnail images
    in the app. That's the playlist!</p>

    <a name="add-navigator"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Add a navigator component</div>
    <p>We're going to need a <span class="docs__technical">&#x3C;Navigator&#x3E;</span> component so that our users can
    switch between the playlist view and the video player that we will add later.</p>
    <p>Modify your <span class="docs__technical">index.js</span> so that it looks like this:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-add-navigator.html" %}
    <p>Right now this doesn't do anything. You will still see the same list of thumbnails, but we expand it later.</p>

    <a name="add-video-player"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Add a video player screen</div>
    <p>Now let's add a new component for actually playing the videos and call it
    <span class="docs__technical">PlayerView</span>. It's just going wrap a
    <span class="docs__technical">YouTube</span> component and add a button to close the video screen.</p>
    <p>Using your text editor, make a new file called <span class="docs__technical">components/PlayerView.js</span> and
    paste in the following code:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-player-view.html" %}
    <p>You will notice that it's expecting to be passed a <span class="docs__technical">videoID</span> and a
    <span class="docs__technical">navigator</span> prop. The button is hooked up to pop the current navigator screen
    when it is pressed.
    <p>Also notice that we have imported the <span class="docs__technical">react-native-youtube</span> library.
    You don't need to install it because all Siphon apps
    <a href="{% url 'docs:faq' %}#base-version">can access it by default</a>.</p>

    <a name="add-video-player-route"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Add a navigator route for the video player</div>
    <p>Now let's modify our <span class="docs__technical">&#x3C;Navigator&#x3E;</span> configuration to support
    the new player screen. Open up <span class="docs__technical">index.js</span> and modify it as follows:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-add-player-route.html" %}
    <p>Now when a view tries to push a new navigator screen containing a <span class="docs__technical">videoID</span>
    in the route definition, our app will load the player view and play the video.</p>

    <a name="trigger-video-player"></a>
    <div class="docs__subheading">Trigger the video player when tapping a video</div>
    <p><strong>Final step.</strong> Let's make it so that when you tap a video thumbnail it actually plays a video for us.</p>
    <p>Open up your <span class="docs__technical">components/VideoListView.js</span> file and add this method
    to the <span class="docs__technical">VideoListView</span> class definition:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-video-list-onpress-method.html" %}
    <p>Then modify the existing <span class="docs__technical">TouchableOpacity</span> declaration
    so that it looks exactly like this:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/youtube-video-list-onpress-hookup.html" %}
    <p><strong>That's it!</strong> Now run <span class="docs__technical">siphon push</span> and
    open up the app. You should be able to tap the videos and watch them.</p>
    <p>You can find the full source code for the finished app on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/getsiphon/siphon-youtube-video-browser">siphon-youtube-video-browser</a></p>
