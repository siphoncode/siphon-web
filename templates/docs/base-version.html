    <div class="docs__headline">Base version</div>
    <p>When you first run the <span class="docs__technical">siphon create</span> command, we
    automatically assign your app a special value called a <span class="docs__technical">base_version</span>
    behind the scenes. Open up the file named <span class="docs__technical">Siphonfile</span> in your app's
    directory to see the currently assigned version.</p>
    <p>It ties your app to a particular <strong>version of React Native</strong> and also guarantees that a certain set
    of <strong>native modules</strong> are available (e.g. <span class="docs__technical">react-native-video</span>) to be used
    within your app's JavaScript code. You don't need to link these native libraries yourself.</p>
    <p>Every few weeks we add a new base version to the list, which includes new native modules and usually the latest version of React Native.</p>

    <div class="docs__subheading">Changing the base version of an app</div>
    <p>The <span class="docs__technical">base_version</span> assigned to an app is
    controlled by the file named <span class="docs__technical">Siphonfile</span> that
    appears in every Siphon app directory. It uses the JSON format and looks something like this:</p>
    {% include "docs/snippets/base-version.html" %}
    <p>To change the base version, edit the
    <span class="docs__technical">Siphonfile</span> and run a <span class="docs__technical">siphon push</span> to reflect
    the change.</p>
    <p>If your app is already published to the App Store or Play Store, you will need to
    run the <span class="docs__technical">siphon publish</span> command again if you would like to change the base version
    of your production app.</p>
